## Utilities

### Homebrew
[Homebrow](https://brew.sh) a package manager for macOS, allow us to install tools directly from the command line

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

### Terminal && Shell
My terminal of choise is [Hyper](https://hyper.is)

```bash
brew install --cask hyper
```

MacOs comes with `zsh` as a default shell, which is what im using. im also using [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) on top of that. `Oh My Zsh` is a framework for managing zsh' configurations.
