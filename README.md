## ‚öíÔ∏è Utilities

### üç∫ Homebrew
[Homebrow](https://brew.sh) a package manager for macOS, allow us to install tools directly from the command line

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

### üêö Terminal and Shell
My terminal of choise is [Hyper](https://hyper.is)

```bash
brew install --cask hyper
```

MacOs comes with `zsh` as a default shell, which is what im using. im also using [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) on top of that. `Oh My Zsh` is a framework for managing zsh' configurations.

#### Oh My Zsh plugins, themes and configurations

# üë®‚Äçüíª Workflow

## üåê Browser

For broswing and web developing im using [chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/). currently considring alternatives like [Arc](https://thebrowser.company/) (DM me for invites) and [SigmaOS](https://sigmaos.com/). Both also supports all the extenstions below.

### Chrome Extentions

* [AdBlock](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adblock-%E2%80%94-best-ad-blocker/gighmmpiobklfepjocnamgkkbiglidom?hl=en) - ad blocker of choise
* [Matter](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/matter/knjbgabkeojmfdhindppcmhhfiembkeb) - my favorite "read it later" app. more on than on the `Matter` section
* [JSONVue](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jsonvue/chklaanhfefbnpoihckbnefhakgolnmc) - pretty print JSONs on the web
* [Natural Reader](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/natural-reader-text-to-sp/kohfgcgbkjodfcfkcackpagifgbcmimk?hl=en) - text to speech reader for the web. can turn any article, mail, documatation into mini podcast

## üöÄ Quick Launcher

### Raycast

[Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) is my favorite tool on the list. Raycast is an all-in-one quick launcher, which lets you do practically everything from its command line. problems I solve with Raycast:

 * Opening everything (app, sites, files)
 * Cliboard history manager
 * Calculator
 * Window management
 * Adding quick tasks to Todoist
 * Adding quick notes to obsidian
 * Glancing on my Jira Tickets
 * Bluetooth management
 * File search

## üìù Note Taking

### Obsidian

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is a powerful and versatile note-taking app. I use it for almost anything.
the fact that it's using a local-first approach and is based on the markdown syntax,
ensures that my notes will ever be mine, and will ever be readable (future proof!)

  #### Theme <a id="Obsidian-Theme"></a>
  
  #### Hotkeys <a id="Obsidian-Hotkeys"></a>
  
  #### Core Plugins <a id="Obsidian-Core-Plugins"></a>
  
  #### Community Plugins <a id="Obsidian-Community-Plugins"></a>


## üìö Read it Later

Read-it-later apps are applications that allow users to save web pages, documents, articles, tweets, and videos to read in a later time.
I often come across some interesting pieces of content that I have no time to read and take notes on it at the moment,
or I don't get any value from it right away but I know I will someday.
I'm currently in the process of moving between apps. My previous go-to app was [Matter](https://hq.getmatter.com/) but now days I'm using [Readwise Reader](https://readwise.io/read) which is perfect.
(after I finished writing this I realized both are SAAS apps, but I think it's still worth a mention)


### Readwise Reader

### Matter

## ü§î Other Apps i Use

### Rocket

[Rocket](https://matthewpalmer.net/rocket/) provides quick access to an emoji keyboard. important.

### Karabiner

[karabiner](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/) lets you re-map some keys in your keyboard. personally, I use it for a single reason - re-mapping my `tab` key to `shift+ctrl+command+option` so it will act as another key I could map shortcuts and hotkeys to. it's also ensures me that no other hotkey will override
my custom ones, because no app will do this key combination.

### Discord

[Discord](https://discord.com/) is like Slack but it won't make you want to poke your eyes with a fork.

### Alt Tab

[Alt Tab](https://alt-tab-macos.netlify.app/) brings the lovable "alt-tab" mechanism from Windows to Macos. it will also show you a window preview before you switch to it.

### Bunch?

[Bunch](https://bunchapp.co/) is an app I currently toying with. it allows you to create automations across your apps. even though it's should be my favorite
app of all time, im not completely sold on this one. needs more playing time with it.
